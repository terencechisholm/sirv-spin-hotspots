# sirv-spin-hotspots
A tool for creating hotspots on 360 Spins from Sirv

I made this tool for anyone to use, to make the process of adding hotspots onto a Sirv 360 Spin or 3D Spin possible to do without coding, and without plotting each frame manually.

Feel free to use it and share it and adapt it to your unique purposes. 

Try it out at http://terence.tech/sirv/hotspots-creator or by downloading this page, and loading locally from your desktop. 


STEPS TO USE IT: 

1.) Make your spin on Sirv.com, and save any customized settings you may wish to add

2.) Copy the web address of your spin file, for example: https://terencechisholm.sirv.com/Spins/Trainers/Trainers.spin

3.) Go to: https://terence.tech/sirv/hotspots-creator and paste in the web address of your spin file, when prompted. 
(For example, https://terencechisholm.sirv.com/Spins/Trainers/Trainers.spin )

4.) The image frames of the spin will load into the top bar of the page, with 'start' and 'end' links below each frame. Click START on the frame you want to start showing a hotspot on, and click END under the frame where you want the hotspot to appear on last. Now that you have selected the start and end keyframes for your hotspots, you can continue with the steps below.

5.) Below the thumbnails, there will be a larger Start Image and a larger End Image. Double-click the area on the larger view of those images, to set the X & Y coordinates for where your hotspot appears when it starts on one frame and ends on another. 

6.) Type in some content into the 'Content' field, to be displayed when a user clicks the hotspot.  (This can be plain text, HTML, iFrames, Scripts and more.)

7.) Click [ PLOT HOTSPOTS ] 

8.) After you click to PLOT HOTSPOTS, some new Spin JSON code will appear in the text area below that button. This is the code which makes a spin with hotspots. If you want to add more hotspots, repeat steps 4-7 for each hotspot. If you have made all the hotspots you want to make, then continue with the steps below.

9.) Copy the new Spin JSON code under "Your Spin with Hotspots", and paste it into a blank plain text file. Save that file with a name that ends with ".spin" like, "Trainers-with-hotspots.spin", and upload it into the folder where your original spin is. For example, https://my.sirv.com/#/browse/Spins/Trainers

10.) Click on the new spin file you uploaded, and view it with hotspots. (Refresh the spin in the browser a few times, to view the latest version)

11.) If you are happy with the results, you can close the window at: http://terence.tech/sirv/hotspots-creator 
If you want to make more hotspots or changes to your hotspots, you can add more (by repeating steps 4-7 above) or undo previously plotted frames (by clicking a number near the undo steps)in https://terence.tech/sirv/hotspots-creator and then start at step 4 again.
